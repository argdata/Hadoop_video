\frametitle{How to study this tutorial}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item After the first pass over the tutorial, you can use it as a reference and review topics in any order
    since it is organized in a modular way and it is easy to find what you might be looking for.
  \item If something is still not clear, ask me questions by e-mail or come see me during my office hours
  \end{itemize}
