\section{Introduction}

  \frametitle{Introduction}
  
\begin{itemize}
\item Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. 
\item It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R
\item Typically all the functionality is available in Scala and Java while APIs 
  in other languages might be behind. For example, Spark's GraphX library is only available in Scala.
\item It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL 
  and structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming.
\item Spark can run within Hadoop cluster and knows how to deal with various 
  Hadoop components (like HDFS, Hive, HBase, etc) and data formats.
\item Spark can also run on a standalone computer or a regular HPC cluster like midway.
\item Spark can utilize multiple nodes and multiple CPU cores in a node.
\end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Introduction}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Python API, {\color{mycolordef}pyspark}, can be used 
    \begin{itemize} 
    \item in batch mode 
    \item interactively 
      \begin{itemize}
      \item in a python command prompt
      \item in Jupyter notebook
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item While {\color{mycolordef}MLlib} - Spark's machine learning library -  has some Neural Network routines, for more advanced Deep Learning framework 
    consider using Spark in combination with {\color{mycolordef}BigDL} library from Intel that knows how to work with Spark's RDDs
  \end{itemize}  
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Introduction}
  
\begin{itemize}
\item Spark was initially started by Matei Zaharia at UC Berkeley's AMPLab in 2009, and open sourced in 2010 under a BSD license.
\item In 2013, the project was donated to the Apache Software Foundation and switched its license to Apache 2.0. 
\item Michael Franklin, who co-founded and directed AMPLab when Spark was created, is now professor and chair at the Computer Science Department of the University of Chicago.
\item The current version of Spark is 2.4.4. 
\item The upcoming version 3.0.0 promises better integration with GPUs and deep learning frameworks, much faster performance
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Introduction}
  
\begin{itemize}
\item Before Spark 2.0, the main abstraction of Spark was the {\color{mycolordef}R}esilient {\color{mycolordef}D}istributed {\color{mycolordef}D}ataset  - {\color{mycolordef}RDD}
\item After Spark 2.0, RDD is replaced by {\color{mycolordef}DataFrame}
\item RDDs are still supported
\item It is recommended now to use {\color{mycolordef}DataFrames} instead of RDDs: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item provides SQL interface to data - more convenient to program
  \item much faster since a query optimization, similar the one used for SQL in RDBM, is applied to queries on DataFrames but not on RDDs
  \end{itemize}
\item We shall cover both since Spark is still in the state of transition. For example:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item There are two streaming libraries: 
      \begin{itemize}
      \item {\color{mycolordef}Structured Streaming}  - based on DataFrames, 
      \item {\color{mycolordef}DStreams} - based on RDDs
      \end{itemize}
    \item There are two APIs to machine learning library: 
      \begin{itemize}
      \item the old one based on RDD is in a maintenance state - only bug fixes are applied to it but no new features are introduced; 
      \item the new machine learning library based on DataFrames is still catching up with the functionality of the old library
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
